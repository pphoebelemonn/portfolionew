            Currently residing in Shanghai, China, I am a third year student at New York University Shanghai
             studying interactive media arts, computer science, social science, and Chinese language. <br> <br>
             I was born in China and adopted at an early age, spending the first 18 years of my life in  Olympia, Washington. 
            I always had a passion for the arts, specifically, performing arts. I’ve been playing cello as a soloist and in ensembles for over 15 years, and though it is not the career path I ended up taking, it truly was my birth as an artist and the driving force for why I am the passionate, ambitious, and creative person that I am today.

                Entering university at NYU Shanghai opened the path to learning about exciting new art and design mediums, as well as immersing myself in new cultures, communities, and peoples. I was introduced to an entire new world of internationals and “expats,” and it was through such an environment where I was able to finally reconcile with my adoptee identity and explore the ways in which I could express it through my artwork. The specific ways that an international community allowed me to thrive and become my true authentic self are too many to go into detail, but I will say that living my life abroad has influenced my art making for the better. It was also during this time that I earned my minor in Chinese Language, able to read, write, and speak at a native level. Though I have studied the language since I was 5, learning on and off throughout early childhood, my now advanced knowledge of the language helped me to understand the nuances of the culture in which I was living in, and by extension, the nuances of my own adoptee experiences.  </div>
